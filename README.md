Hi there 👋 I'm
# 👧 Maria Dimansi Chrysandini
- ✏️ I'm currently a final-year Computer Science student trying to be more active✔️ in exploring my potential in science and technology field! 💻
- 👀 Well, although there's no valuable repo you can see up there 👆 There are some of them I put in private mode 🔐 Still need courage to show them off considering they're not worth seeing enough 🙅
- 🍑but... you can still see some of my small works ➡️ on my [codepen](https://codepen.io/mdchrysan/) page💗
- 📬 For now, you can reach me via my personal email: _chrysan.scorpio@gmail.com_ ✨ 

Gracias!🎇

<!--**mdchrysan/mdchrysan** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on my GitHub profile. -->
